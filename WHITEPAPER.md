## Notice

> PLEASE READ THIS WHITEPAPER IN ITS ENTIRETY AND ONLY AFTER THOROUGH RESEARCH ON YOUR PART, IF YOU DECIDE YOU WOULD LIKE TO INVEST AND SUPPORT THIS PROJECT, PLEASE STAY WITHIN YOUR MEANS.

This project is has been created and will be developed by Nlaak Studios, LLC a Texas-based S-Corp. Currently, the online sites are traditional sites with licensed code and so are private repositories. However, the project, when finished will be 100% decentralized and governed by the community.

With the migration of the current traditional centralized sites to off-shore dedicated servers that are secure and provide favourable data security laws complete, we have only left GWF.IO (Social) and Media-Junky.com (Video Sharing) online at this time. The others will be available again when we release the new Decentralized Platform, including the complete re-write of GWF Social and Media Junky.

Once the Core Development team is in place we will get the Official Whitepaper and Road map released.

## About Us

### Tagline

Your Social Platform, Your Way! We are the unified decentralized social platform for all!

### Mission

To provide a secure social media platform able to serve any content distributor while ensuring Privacy, user control.

### Vision

To build a system of social networking that gives users Privacy, Security, and Freedom on their legal content distribution.

### Summary

GWF is a unified decentralized social media platform that allows you to be responsible for your content.
Global wealth and Freedom platform allow for all types of content Social Networking, Video Sharing, and Instant Messaging with Audio & Video calls, Micro-Blogging, Blogging, DEX, and much more.

GWF is a no censoring, no tracking, and no ads platform where you have complete control of your online presence, content, security, and Privacy.
You will love the GWF platform as it doesn't use cookies â€“ otherwise known as trackers- to generate revenue; hence you can be confident that we do not sell your content to advertisers. The platform also allows for ultimate freedom of expression as there is no censoring, thus enabling you to take control and push your content. 

We believe users can think for themselves and hence be able to decide what they want to consume. Therefore, the ultimate goal is not for us to "Define" the platform - but rather to listen to our user's feedback and suggestions and build the social platform for the future.
With GWF, you can say goodbye to big tech with all their tracking, ads, and censoring and say Hello to your personalized social network where you have full control of your online presence, content, security, and Privacy.

However, this system is not intended for "Drug Lords," "Arms Dealers," and "Developers of Mass Destruction." It's intended to protect the rights and privacy of law-abiding everyday end users. We must also still abide by the "Know Your Customer" (KYC) and "Anti Money Laundering" (AML) laws as set forth and must be honoured in most countries on the planet.

Best of all ... It's all one a single App and uniform across all platforms. Leave off on your desktop and pick up on the go with your mobile. It's all seamless.

### Core Values

#### Privacy

Keep your content within the locus of your control. With our no ads policy, your data is not sold to advertisers as an income generation scheme. We will strive to implement every feature known to protect the identity of the users of this token. Strong encryption. No one should be aware that you are using this system unless you somehow make them aware of it.

#### Security

As with Privacy, we will strive to implement the most robust security features, but with emphasis on not hindering the end, users' use of the system. There will be many layers of security that you can turn on or off when desired.

#### Performance

With the Front-end primary app created with Flutter, it allows for a single code base for developers (Web, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux) and a standardized and easy-to-use interface for the users.

#### Versatility

As long as your content remains to be legal, we don't practice censorship. It is our firm belief that anyone who uses our platform is able to choose for themselves what they want to consume.

#### Sustainability

We are using the absolute latest in technology to create the only 100% decentralized & Self-Sustaining Social Platform for the future.

## BLOCKCHAIN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM

Decentralized social networks will become widespread in the aftermath of the Facebook and Twitter censorship issues as well as the Facebook, Cambridge Analytica scandal.

And then there's the fact that people just want their privacy and they don't want to be tracked and have their information sold for ad targeting.

### com.nlaak.gwf.blockchain

Global Wealth &amp; Freedom Blockchain is built with Ethereum Technology (go-ethereum) which provides the core components and tools to join the new, borderless economy and society.
It will be a fully sovereign Ethereum-compatible blockchain network. Our network is fully in charge of our own security, i.e. have our own pool of validators. Our Stand-alone chain offers the highest level of independence and flexibility.

#### Account Breakdown & Summary

As stated on our [project page](https://landing.gwf.io) our `Core Values` are

- Privacy: Simple control over whom sees what
- Security: You own your keys, therefore your content
- Versatility: Protocols allow infinite expansion
- Performance: Lighting fast blockchain (6 sec)
- Sustainability: Official Validators instead of Miners (energy/cost savings). All content stored on IPFS and backed up to Filecoin

The best way to see how we go about doing this is to take a look and an example master account file.

### Current Configurable properties

These are provided by the `User` object

- Username -> Your unique username (Required)
- avatar -> the CID of your avatar on GWFStorage
- Status -> your current status (online, away, dnd, etc)
- Name -> your real name
- Email -> your email address
- Mobile -> your mobile phone number
- Gender -> [M]ale, [F]emale, [O]ther, [U]ndefined (Default)
- Country -> your country code ie. [US]
- Bio -> short text, anything you desire
- FollowingCount -> Number of accounts your following (in progress)
- FollowAccounts -> The list of accounts you are following (in progress)
- FollowerCount -> Number of accounts your following you (in progress)
- FollowerAccounts -> The list of accounts that are following you (in progress)

Please note that everything defaults to `Private`. You must add accounts to the groups and choose which properties to make visible for each group. You can see an example of this in the Account JSON above.

##### Allowed Devices

Just like many other apps you can save and allow access to only certain devices. These are provided (if any) in the `Account.Devices` property.

##### Preferences

TODO

##### Following

TODO

##### Followers

TODO

##### Share Groups

GWF Smartchain uses what we call `share groups` to give the user simple and total control over
<u>who can view what content</u>. At this time we just have these basic properties available

###### Available Share Groups

- 0 Private         (DEFAULT) only owner has full access
- 1 Family          Accounts in this group can view allowed content
- 2 Friends         Accounts in this group can view allowed content
- 3 Coworkers       Accounts in this group can view allowed content
- 4 Followers       Accounts in this group can view allowed content
- 5 Denied          Accounts in this group cannot view any content
- 6 Public          Anyone can view allowed content

All of this happens on-chain. All encryption and decryption happen on-chain storing/retrieving content. So everything
stored on GWFStorage (IPFS/Filecoin) is 100% secured for each individual user

In the app, you will be able to very easily configure your share groups. There are two (2) steps that must be done.

- First, configure each shared groups properties. These are Checkboxes for all properties which are `unchecked` by default. `Check` the properties you want <u>this</u> group to view.
- Second, add users to each `share group`. Under each group, you can add a user via

  1. Magic URL Link via Mobile Text Message (Enter Phone #)
  2. Magic URL Link via Email (Enter Email)
  3. Scan QR Code
  4. Enter User Account Address Manually

Let's say you have a coworker who becomes a good friend. You simply move their account address from the `Coworker` group to the `Friends` group. There is also a `Denied` group where you can place any accounts that you do not wish to have access to any of your content.

###### Why go through so much trouble?

We believe that the user owns their content and should have any amount of privacy that they desire. We also extend this
to cryptocurrencies on our DEX. No one should know what you are buying, selling or holding in your wallet. Your Defi wallet is a separate account only visible to you. You cannot expose it to your `Share Groups`. We do not believe that governments should have permission to monitor and tax you at this point. When you move your crypto to a government fiat currency, then the laws and taxes applicable to the fiat should be applied.

So, the answer to the question is simple. If `WE` as an entity providing you with service cannot decrypt and see the content - then a <u>supena is worthless</u>.

##### Protocols

Protocols allow us to determine what app handler should process the data once it is decrypted on your device. For example, if someone you are following posted a tweet on `Credo` (our version of Twitter) that is where it would be sent within the app. On the other hand, if you have a notification of say a new blog post then it would be sent to that handler.

This allows us to infinitely add content to the app over time by using the same underlying processes.

#### Example Account JSON

Below you will find an example master file for a user account. This file is saved on GWF Storage encrypted with your key so that only you can access the contents.<br />
<u>No other access is possible unless you share your account address and pass phrase</u>.

> ^^^ <b>DO NOT EVER, EVER DO THAT</b> ^^^

This file is only updated when

- You post content
- Update Shared Groups
- Update your User Information

When you start the app, this is the first thing to be retrieved, decrypted on your device and then populated in your UI.

## GWF Primary Token (ERC20)

This token is used for raising the Working Capital needed to complete the project and will represent the overall value of the Platform and its success. It is a standard ERC20 Finite (Limited Supply) token on the Ethereum Blockchain. You can find more details below.

Besides everything you can do with an Ethereum Token, you will also be able to SWAP for GWFU (GWF Utility Tokens) used by the platform and GWFS (GWF Stable Coin) directly the GWF DEX.

### Contract Details

### Planned Token Allocation
<p style="color:red">Disregard - Out of date. Will be updated</p>

All tokens (The Total Supply) are currently sitting in a wallet until the Core Team / Co-Founders are brought on board. At this time all the final details/values will be agreed upon. The table below is a design estimate and is not guaranteed. The Estimated Value in USD column below is based on $0.30 USD per Token. This is the average of the Crowdfunding Start and Ending prices and are subject to change.

All project (Management & Team) token allotments will be regulated by the smart contract allowing for the optional sale of up to 5% every 3 months (90 days) and will not carry over.

All remaining Project Development Funds (after Allotments) will be used to cover operations and expenses.
